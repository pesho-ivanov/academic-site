Grew up with informatics olympiads, studied applied math, started as a programmer. Introduced practical A\* for optimal sequence alignment for my PhD in computational biology. To reprogram living cells, we need better science and better compbio infrastructure. I enjoy teaching algorithms and develop stuff together.
