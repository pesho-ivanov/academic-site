Grew up with informatics olympiads, studied applied math, started as a programmer. Introduced practical A\* for optimal sequence alignment for my PhD in computational biology. To reprogram living cells, we need better science and better compbio infrastructure. I enjoy teaching algorithms and develop stuff together.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
